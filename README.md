This Discord bot automatically detects and bans newly created accounts (created on the same day). It flags potential alt accounts, logs the action in a designated channel, and sends a DM to the banned user with instructions to contact the designated contact person if they believe the ban was a mistake. It's an automated safeguard against harassment. (PS: Absolutely free)
